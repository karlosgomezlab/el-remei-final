(Self-correction: I cannot use write_to_file for binary images easily without a path. But wait, the system usually maps images to paths or I can just reference it if it's already in the workspace. However, the user says "the photography that I pass you". Usually, this means I should save it or it's been uploaded to the workspace.)

Actually, I see the image in the prompt. I will use the `generate_image` tool or similar if needed? No, the user provided a real photo. 

Let me check the `apps/client/public` directory to see if there's already a place for it or if I should create one.
